## Install/usage

1. Follow this [quickstart](http://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/) guide, if you don't have hugo yet.

2. Replace it with the extended one from Cyrill:

        pushd .
        cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/spf13/hugo
        git remote add schumacherfm https://github.com/SchumacherFM/hugo.git
        git fetch schumacherfm
        git checkout -b sourcejson schumacherfm/SchumacherFM_SourceJSON
        go get
        popd

2. Clone this repo with submodules:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/pcdummy/hugo-lightslider-example

3. Change into the newly created directory and run hugo:

        cd hugo-lightgallery
        hugo server -w -D -t purehugo

4. Open [your-local-copy](http://localhost:1313) - yes it runs from your computer :)

Its save to ignore the `Symbolic links not supported, skipping` errors on the output.

Wasn't that easy?
